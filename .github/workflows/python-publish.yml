            ## Improvements
            - New Function:
              - get_measure_dependencies: Gets the dependency tree for given measures or all measures in a Power BI report, optionally including visual IDs.
            - Updated Function:
              - remove_measures: check_visual_usage flag now checks usage in dependant measures as well.
